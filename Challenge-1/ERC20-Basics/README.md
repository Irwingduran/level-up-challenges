# ðŸš€ Master the ERC20 Token Standard

Welcome to the first mission of Scroll Dev Challenge!

All of you are probably familiar with tokens like WETH, USDT, USDC, and many others. Did you know that all of these tokens are designed by following some standard rules?

Let's get started! ðŸ’ª

## Objective

Your task is to:

1. Develop your own ERC20 token.
2. Deploy it to Scroll Sepolia Testnet.
3. And finally verify it.

If you need help with using a smart contract framework for completing this challenge, the [Level Up: Build with Foundry](https://www.levelup.xyz/content/level-up-foundry) guide might be a helpful start!

If you get stuck, feel free to ask for help in [Level Up Telegram group](https://t.me/+PdNbk5milo1mMTAy).

## High Level Structure

**1. START WITH THE GUIDE IN [LEVEL UP](https://www.levelup.xyz/challenges/ERC20)**

Guide: Begin your journey with the guide. Here you'll find the basic functionality of ERC20 tokens and how to get started.

**2. CLONE THIS REPO AND COMPLETE THE [CHALLENGE](./Challenge/ERC20-Challenge.sol)**

Assignment: Complete this challenge. Put your knowledge to the test by cloning this repo and completing this challenge by deploying your own ERC20 token and deploying it to Scroll Sepolia Testnet with Foundry.

    }
}

## Conclusion

This mission will be the first step of your smart contract development journey. You will use this practice in the upcoming missions a lot.

Remember, the journey is as rewarding as the destination. Embrace the mission, and let's revolutionize the world of finance together!
